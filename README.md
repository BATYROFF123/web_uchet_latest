pet project 

seems like full stack application

for the application to work, you must have mongodb/mongo compass

<p>to start frontend side you need to write on bash or cmd:
<code>
npm run dev
</code></p>

to start backend side you need to write on bash or cmd:
<code>
npm start
</code>

when application start work:
1) you should write in tree input your numbers
2) press button 'отправить'
3) in history list and in database you can see your numbers
